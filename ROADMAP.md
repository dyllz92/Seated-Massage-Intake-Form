**Project Goal:** Build a locally-hosted web app for clients to complete intake forms via mobile browser, with secure PDF storage in Google Drive.

**Last Updated:** January 21, 2026

---

## Current Status
- ✅ Repository initialized
- ✅ Core implementation complete
- ✅ MVP features functional
- ✅ Universal intake form with comprehensive health screening
- ✅ Gender-based body mapping system
- ✅ Color-coded health disclaimers (Red/Orange/Yellow/Green)

## Priority Tasks Remaining

### High Priority (Required for Production)
1. **Set up public access solution** - Configure ngrok or Cloudflare Tunnel for internet access
2. **Configure HTTPS** - Ensure secure transmission for HIPAA compliance
3. **Generate QR code** - Create QR code linking to the form for easy mobile access
4. **Mobile device testing** - Test form on actual mobile devices (iOS/Android)

### Medium Priority (Quality & Maintenance)
1. **Basic unit tests** - Add tests for `pdfGenerator` and API routes
2. **Documentation** - Create setup guide for tunneling/HTTPS configuration

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements)
1. **Admin dashboard** - For viewing submissions
2. **Email notifications** - On form submission
3. **Multi-language support** - For diverse client base
4. **Form analytics** - Usage and completion metrics
5. **Backup/export** - Additional data management features
