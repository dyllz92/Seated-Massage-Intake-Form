  - Muscle map clears when gender is changed to prevent confusion

  - Updated [public/js/quick-form.js](public/js/quick-form.js) for quick form

### January 21, 2026 (Morning)
- Switched to a single universal intake form (no quick vs detailed split). [views/intake.html](views/intake.html), [public/js/intake-form.js](public/js/intake-form.js), redirects in [server.js](server.js#L25-L33)
- Updated home page to one CTA: Start Intake. [views/index.html](views/index.html)

- Updated filename format: `ChairMassageIntake_{fullName}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HHmm}.pdf`. [server.js](server.js#L88-L96)
- Launcher clears ports and auto-opens the app; reads `PORT` from `.env`. [run-app.bat](run-app.bat)
- Health endpoint available: `/api/health` reports Drive configuration status. [server.js](server.js#L66-L74)
- Google Drive uploader supports local fallback when `ALLOW_LOCAL_PDF_FALLBACK=true`. [utils/driveUploader.js](utils/driveUploader.js)

### January 20, 2026
- Updated roadmap to reflect actual implementation status
- Most core features are complete and functional
- Identified remaining tasks:
  - Home page needs to display both form options (Quick + Detailed)
  - Muscle map visualization needs to use actual SVG body diagrams instead of canvas drawing
- Added interactive muscle map feature (canvas-based with dot placement)
- Server running successfully on port 3000
- PDF generation and Google Drive integration working

---

## Next Milestones (Q1 2026)
- [x] Replace canvas body map with gender-specific PNG diagrams (female/male) ✅ January 21, 2026
- [x] Add gender selection to all forms ✅ January 21, 2026
- [x] Enhanced conditional field hiding (Other fields, allergies, medications) ✅ January 21, 2026
- [ ] Robust validation and UX polish on mobile (sticky actions, banners)
- [ ] Basic unit tests for `pdfGenerator` and API routes

---

## Testing / Regression
- Body map E2E: select dots → submit → reload record → PDF includes same selections.
- Required validation: fullName, mobile, consent, signature.
- Conditional “Other” fields appear only when selected.
- PDF generation succeeds.
- Drive upload succeeds; fallback works when enabled.

### January 19, 2026
- Added dual-form approach: Quick 60-second form vs. Detailed intake form
- Home page will feature Flexion & Flow logo, welcome message, and two form options
- Defined all form fields for both intake forms
- Confirmed: Internet-accessible via WiFi or mobile network (requires public URL solution)
- Ready to begin implementation pending logo file and Google Drive setup confirmationAO
- Ready to begin implementation pending logo file and network access decisions
